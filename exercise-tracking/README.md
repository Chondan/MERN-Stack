# MERN Stack

## Lesson Learned
- ObjectId generated by MongoDB consists of 3 different parts -> UNIX Timestamp (4 bytes) + Random Value (5 bytes) + Count (3 bytes)
- 1 bytes = 8 bit, 4 bit = 1 char
- Typically, we create backend folder seperately from the front-end folder. But in this case (simple app) we do create it inside the front-end folder
- Using `Insomnia` for testing API
- Bootstrap -> https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/getting-started/introduction/
- `<DatePicker />` -> `npm install react-datepicker`
	- Link: https://reactdatepicker.com/
- axios -> `npm install axios`

The MERN stack consists of the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A document-based open source database.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
- React: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).

and Mongoose: Simple, schema-based solution to model application data.
